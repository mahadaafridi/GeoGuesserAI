1. Project Setup and Planning
Define Objectives:
Clearly state what your models should accomplish. In your case, the CNN should predict the location from a given outdoor image, and you'll compare its performance with a Vision Transformer.

2. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
Dataset Sourcing:
Identify datasets that include outdoor landscape images along with geolocation metadata. Public datasets such as Im2GPS or others might be good starting points.
Data Cleaning:
Remove any images that might be corrupted or lacking sufficient metadata.
Preprocessing:
For the frontend and model, decide on a consistent image size, normalization techniques, and possibly data augmentation (e.g., rotations, flips) to help the model generalize.
3. Building the Frontend
User Interface Design:
Plan how users will interact with your system. Will they upload images via a web form? What feedback do you provide once the prediction is made?
Frontend Development:
Develop the UI using your chosen framework. Ensure that it's responsive and user-friendly.
Integration with Backend:
Establish endpoints for image upload and result retrieval.
4. Developing the Backend
API Design:
Create RESTful API endpoints that accept an image and return the predicted location.
Model Integration:
Prepare your backend to load the trained CNN model and later the Vision Transformer, process incoming images, and return predictions.
Server Setup:
Use frameworks like Flask or Django to build the server, and consider deployment aspects early (e.g., Docker, cloud platforms).
5. Model Development and Training
CNN Model:
Architecture: Decide on the layers and architecture for your CNN.
Training: Write scripts to train your model using the preprocessed dataset.
Evaluation: Set aside a validation and test set to evaluate performance (e.g., location prediction accuracy, geolocation error).
Vision Transformer Model Comparison:
Setup: Identify a pre-existing Vision Transformer model you can use.
Benchmarking: Run the same tests and compare performance metrics against your CNN.
6. Testing, Evaluation, and Iteration
Unit Testing:
Write tests for each component (frontend, backend, data preprocessing, model inference).
Integration Testing:
Verify that the entire pipeline (from image upload to prediction display) works seamlessly.
Performance Tuning:
Based on evaluation metrics, iterate on model parameters and the overall system to improve prediction accuracy.
7. Deployment and Maintenance
Deploying the Application:
Choose a platform (AWS, Heroku, etc.) and deploy your backend and frontend.
Monitoring:
Set up logging and monitoring to catch issues and track usage.
Future Improvements:
Consider options for real-time improvements, adding more data, or refining the user interface based on feedback.
